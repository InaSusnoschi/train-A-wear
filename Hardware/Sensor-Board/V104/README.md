## IMU Sensor Board V1.04

Changes to previous version:

* Reordered schematics to facilitate manual component placement on the PCB
* Resized the PCB to be smaller so it can fit in the box for the device
* Cut out a bit of the board so that the mCU antenna sticks out for better reception, as per datasheet suggestions.
* Manually placed and routed all components
* Increased trace width for tracks
* Etched out PCB version on the bottom of the sensor
